An administrative command-line tool for JustServe Specialists and administrators.

== Prerequisites

Before using the CLI, you must authenticate your session.

. Set the `MICRONAUT_HTTP_SERVICES_JUSTSERVE_TOKEN` environment variable with a valid API token obtained from the JustServe platform.
+
[source,powershell]
----
# For PowerShell (Windows)
$env:MICRONAUT_HTTP_SERVICES_JUSTSERVE_TOKEN = "your_api_token_here"
----
+
[source,bash]
----
# For Bash (Linux/macOS)
export MICRONAUT_HTTP_SERVICES_JUSTSERVE_TOKEN="your_api_token_here"
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This token is used to authorize your requests to the JustServe API. Ensure it has the necessary permissions for the operations you intend to perform.
====

== Usage

The primary command is `justserve`. You can run it from your terminal once you have the executable file.

=== Generating a Temporary Password

The main function of this tool is to generate a new temporary password for a user, which is useful for resolving account access issues.

To generate a password, use the `--email` or `-e` option, followed by the user's email address.

.Command Syntax
[source,bash]
----
./justserve --email <user_email>
----

.Example Request
[source,bash]
----
./justserve --email user@example.com
----

If the request is successful, the tool will print the new temporary password directly to the console.

.Example Success Output
----
t3mpP@ssw0rd!
----

=== Checking the Tool Version

To display the current version of the `justserve-cli` tool, use the `--version` or `-v` flag. This is helpful for ensuring you are using the latest release.

.Command Syntax
[source,bash]
----
./justserve --version
----

.Example Output
[source,text]
----
0.0.3-SNAPSHOT
----

== Error Handling

If the tool encounters an issue—such as an invalid email, an authentication failure, or a server-side problem—it will print a descriptive error message to the standard error stream.

.Example Error Output
[source,text]
----
received an unexpected response from JustServe: 404 (Not Found)
