## General Styling Guide

The name of the game is readability and [testability]. The following styling specifics reference Java, but are applicable to kotlin and groovy. 
- Packages should be all lowercase ASCII letters.
- Classes and Interfaces should follow a mixed case (aka "camel case"), with each subsequent word's first letter capitalized
    - e.g. `class TestClass`
- Follow [google's styleguide] for documentation. 
- Methods should be verb-based names, and should follow a mixed case (aka "camel case") pattern, with the first letter of the first word in lower case.
    - e.g. `void testMethod()`
    - Braces follow the Kernighan and Ritchie style ("Egyptian brackets") for nonempty blocks and block-like constructs:
    - Don't wrap a line just for the sake of not going past the 100 character marker. focus on readability.
    - Variables should have meaningful names, even in lambdas. There's no shortage of space, so write readable code whose names are indicative of their use.
      - Single character variable names or similar are not permitted. 
    - Example:
    ```java
    public String getReturnedResponse(Request request) {
        OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient().newBuilder().build();
        String returnedResponse;
        try (Response response = client.newCall(request).execute()) {
            if (response.body() != null) {
                returnedResponse = response.body().string();
            } else {
                throw new RuntimeException("Body of returned response is null.");
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
        return returnedResponse;
    }
    ``` 
    - Variables are similar to methods, in that they should follow a mixed case (aka "camel case") patter, with a
      lowercase first letter.

### Testing

- Methods and Features are to have [adequate] unit and integration tests written before any pull request can be accepted. 
- Because we use lombok, we don't need to test setters and getters. Using getters and setters is the preferred way to access class fields. 
- Unit test count is to scale appropriately according to the complexity of the method.
- Features are to have [adequate] integration and end-to-end tests.
- Fixes are to have [adequate] unit, integration and end-to-end tests included with the fix for the sake of [regression testing].
- Tests should only test one thing
    - e.g. `Set store location with zip code.`
    - e.g. `Fail to set store location using invalid zip code`
    - e.g. `Set store location by city name`

#### Adequate Testing Coverage
Adequate testing is determined by the method's documentation (this is why all methods require docs). Testing is surgical and specific; test exactly what is documented, no more and no less. If it's in the docs, then [test it]! The only exception to this is that [branches of code] should be covered in testing, which may not be documented.
